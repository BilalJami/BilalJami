<h2>Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm BILAL JAMI</h2>
Hello, I am from Lahore, Pakistan, and a Software Developer & Designer passionate about creating amazing stuff for the Developer's side.

My interest started in late 2021 (Even if I was studying computer for the previous many years) when I saw that a boy of my age is running a software company and he also belongs to my city and got the Awards from President Pakistan And he also conducting seminars at the Universities of Pakistan. Then I promised myself wholeheartedly that I can do this at work also and I will show it. Because my first challenge was to complete my education which I completed with great difficulties.

I learned a lot from youtube w3schools and mentorsh.com. Apart from all this, a friend of mine who raised my spirits was <b>Rao Mohammad Saleem.</b>

I'm skilled in Python Numpy Pandas Matplotlib TKinter MySQL JavaScript, CSS, Reactjs, Node/express js, Git & Github.
I'm a team person, working together with people has helped me develop because I tend to learn and challenge myself to do more.

Over The time, I have learned to pick different projects to improve my coding skills, which has helped me. I pick projects from Frontendmentor, Dribble, and more.

I like coding, gaming, and reading Islamic history to know why Islam is closer to the nature of humanities. I don't give up on anything no matter the result I am getting, always want results and never give up until I achieve that. I've stayed up all night debugging just because I don't want to leave the bug unfixed.
